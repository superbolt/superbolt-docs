</doc-anchor-target>
<p>PLEASE READ THE ENTIRETY OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE WEBSITES (AS DEFINED BELOW).
NOTHING HEREIN CONSTITUTES LEGAL, FINANCIAL, BUSINESS OR TAX ADVICE AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR(S) BEFORE ENGAGING IN ANY ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION TO SUPERBOLT. (THE <strong>SITE OPERATOR</strong>) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY KIND OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS WHATSOEVER WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER IN CONNECTION WITH ACCESSING THE PAPER, DECK OR OTHER MATERIAL RELATING TO SUPERBOLT OR PUBLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH SUPERBOLT (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, ANY CONTENT PUBLISHED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS MAINTAINTED BY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH SUPERBOLT) (COLLECTIVELY, THE <strong>TOKEN DOCUMENTATION</strong>) AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITES AT HTTPS://WWW.SUPERBOLT.WTF (THE <strong>WEBSITES</strong>, INCLUDING ANY SUB-DOMAINS THEREON).</p>
<p><strong>By using the Websites you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Websites.</strong></p>

        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#1-about-the-website">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span>1. About the Website</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The Website is operated by the Site Operator (also referred to as “<strong>we</strong>“). The user of the Websites is also referred to as “<strong>you</strong>“ throughout these Terms.</p>
<p>The Websites provide users with an interface to interact with the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol (as defined below). Among other things, the Websites aggregate and publish publicly available third-party information about the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol. The Websites also offer interaction methods whereby you can indicate a transaction that you would like to perform in connection with the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol (such as swapping one token for another). When used in this way, the relevant Website can generate a draft transaction message which you can independently use together with a third-party wallet application or device to conduct transactions on Cosmos Chains. Before using information from the Websites (including any draft transaction messages) to engage in transactions, you must independently verify the accuracy of such information (and the consistency of such draft transaction messages with your intended use).</p>
<p>All interactions between users on the Website or the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol operate in a peer-to-peer manner. Users, traders and liquidity providers enter into a direct contractual relationship via the autonomous smart contracts allowing users to create derivative tokens or trade in these derivative tokens, and therefore these users assume mutual responsibilities and obligations. There is no further control by or interaction with the Site Operator (or the relevant affiliate) which had deployed the smart contract. The Site Operator and its affiliates shall in no circumstances be construed as a party to said peer-to-peer direct contractual relationship, is not liable for performance of obligations thereunder, nor does it bear any financial or commercial risk or provide any warranties or assurances in connection with the same.</p>
<p>Using a Cosmos chain or the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol does not require use of the Websites. The Websites aggregate and publish publicly available information about Cosmos cains and the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol in a user-friendly and convenient format. Such information is also independently available from other sources—for example, a person may directly review Cosmos chain transaction history, account balances and the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol on a Cosmos chain block explorer.</p>
<p>By combining publicly available information with a user’s interactions with the relevant Website, such Website can draft standard transaction messages compatible with the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol which are designed to accomplish a user’s operational goals as expressed through the interactions. If you choose to, you can also publish such messages on Cosmos chain in order to initiate token transactions.</p>
<p>All draft transaction messages are delivered by the relevant Website via API to your compatible third-party Cosmos chain wallet application or device selected by you after pressing the “Connect Wallet” button. You must personally review and authorize all transaction messages that you want to send to Cosmos chain; you are required to sign the relevant transaction message with a private cryptographic key which is inaccessible to the Website. The user-authorized message will then be broadcast to validators on Cosmos chain through the wallet application or device and you may pay a network fee to have such validators apply the transaction message to the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol and record the results on Cosmos chain, meaning that a token transaction is completed on Cosmos chain.</p>
<p>Neither the Site Operator nor the Websites themselves are your agents or intermediaries, they do not store or have access to or control over any tokens, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property belonging to a user, and they are not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on your behalf. The Websites do not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens. All transactions relating to the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol are effected and recorded solely through the interactions of a user with the Cosmos chain validators, who are not under the control of or affiliated with the Site Operator or the Websites.</p>
<p>Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol means the source code at <a href="https://github.com/superbolt">https://github.com/superbolt</a>, which is a slow unbonding arbitrage protocol built on Cosmos chain, where you can invest in arbitrage pools that will automatically execute.</p>
