# Getting Started

Superbolt is an NFTfi protocol built around a best in class marketplace and launchpad. Our protocol is purpose built from the ground up. We have completely reimagined the mechanics of NFTfi, creating powerful new utilities for NFTs with deep DeFi functionality.

What this means in practice is itâ€™s a place where Creators, Collectors, and Traders can come together and participate meaningfully. Creators can launch collections using the powerful yet easy to use Foundry launchpad. Collectors and Traders can mint NFTs with randomness assured. In addition there is a unified UI for both marketplace listed and fractionalised NFTs available from the liquidity pools.

## What is Superbolt?

Superbolt comprises three integrated pillars: Marketplace, Foundry and NFTfi.

### 1. Marketplace

Feature rich trading hub and gateway for NFT trading on Neutron. Our marketplace is a flagship product with stunning UI and intuitive UX. Interchain transfers mean existing collections can also trade on Superbolt.

### 2. Foundry

Innovative, no code NFT launchpad - ideal for both new and experienced creators. Our Foundry launchpad is the easiest place to launch NFTs in web3 for both experienced NFT creators and first time users.

### 3. NFTfi

Superbolt empowers users and communities through advanced Defi functionality for NFTs. Integrating Defi to the NFT scene facilitates as yet unseen yield generation strategies for NFTs.
