# Fractionalized NFTs

## What is NFT fractionalization?

NFT Fractionalization is the process of dividing ownership of a single NFT into multiple smaller parts, allowing multiple people to own a share of it. This makes expensive or highly valuable NFTs more accessible to a wider audience, as buyers can purchase fractions (or tokens) representing partial ownership instead of buying the entire NFT.

### How Does NFT Fractionalization Work?

1. Locking the NFT:
The original NFT is locked in a smart contract.

2. Creating Fractions:
The contract mints fungible tokens representing ownership shares of the NFT.

3. Trading Fractions: These tokens can then be traded using Superbolt Liquidity Pools.
   
4. Reunification (Optional): If one party buys enough fractions, they can reclaim full NFTs from the *Particle Accelerator*.
   
## Why Fractionalize an NFT?
- **Accessibility**: Allows more people to invest in expensive NFTs.
- **Liquidity**: Users can provide liquidity to the LP to earn rewards.
- **Tradability**: Fractionalized NFTs can be traded easily, unlike whole NFTs, which might take longer to sell.
- **Community Ownership**: A group of people can collectively own and benefit from an NFT.
- **Price Discovery**: Market-driven pricing as fractions trade freely.

## How to fractionalise an NFT

The Superbolt *Particle Accelerator* allows NFT holders to exchange NFTs for particles. The user locks their NFT in the *Particle Accelerator* Smart Contract and receives either a fixed or variable number of fractions in return.

The algorithm used is determined by the NFT collection creator. Either:

- Fixed number of fractions for each NFT in the collection
- Variable number of fractions for NFTs based upon rarity
