When used in this way, the relevant Website can generate a draft transaction message which you can independently use together with a third-party wallet application or device to conduct transactions on Cosmos Chains. Before using information from the Websites (including any draft transaction messages) to engage in transactions, you must independently verify the accuracy of such information (and the consistency of such draft transaction messages with your intended use).","All interactions between users on the Website or the Superbolt Smart Contract Protocol operate in a peer-to-peer manner. Users, traders and liquidity providers enter into a direct contractual relationship via the autonomous smart contracts allowing users to create derivative tokens or trade in these derivative tokens, and therefore these users assume mutual responsibilities and obligations.
